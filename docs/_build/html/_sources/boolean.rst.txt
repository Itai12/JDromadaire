Boolean, if else and logical operators
======================================

Boolean
=======

Like others language, boolean are defined with ``true`` and ``false``

For example, defined a ``x`` variable which is a boolean and will be true can be done as the follow : ::

	x = true
	
If and else
===========

For the moment, juste the if is implemented, but ``else`` and ``elseif`` will come soon.

You can use it as he follow : ::

	a=true
	if(a){
		print("a is true")
	}
	
Logical operators
=================

You can use the Java/C/C++ synthax for boolean logic : 

For example : ::

	> true || false
	true
	> true && false
	false
	> !true
	false
